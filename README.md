Objectives:
- [x] Make requests to the chuck norris joke database
      - This database is pretty offensive in content.
      - *Trigger warning* - https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/FnWEVtdzTm2XDCQV9ibjgA doesn't seem like it should be used in a test
      - Because of this, I'm gonna stop using that API (but feel free to checkout the previous commits
      - Instead, I will be using this API: https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable 
- [ ] document usage
- [ ] push to github
- [ ] ship it?
